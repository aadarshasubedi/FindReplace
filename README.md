# FindReplace
An old tool I made in Visual Basic 2012 that uses MS Office Interop. 

The idea was something that could go through all the word files in a folder and replace certain text placeholders with some other text sentence.

There was also a part about inserting sentences before or after placeholders in all docs in a folder but I think I lose that project in one of my old hard drives.
